# MACRON B2B TECHNICAL COMPONENTS: BUSINESS MODEL DEFINITIONS

## Overview

Macron has developed a portfolio of 10 innovative technical components for the fashion industry, ranging from moisture-control liners to bio-based water repellents. To commercialize these innovations in the B2B market, two distinct partnership models have been evaluated:

1. **Co-Branded Model** ("Powered by Macron")
2. **White-Label Model** (Private Label Manufacturing)
